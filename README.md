This project is a JavaFX-based mortgage calculator that allows users to enter the cost of a house and the annual interest rate to compute the monthly mortgage payment. The interface includes input fields for house cost and interest rate, a checkbox to optionally add $5000 in closing costs to the loan, and radio buttons to select either a 15-year or 30-year loan term. The application calculates the monthly payment using the standard amortization formula and displays the result in currency format. Input validation is built in, so the program will display an alert if the user enters non-numeric values, a negative house cost, or an interest rate outside the valid range of 0.0 to 1.0. The layout is styled using a BorderPane with custom font and color settings for a polished user experience. This project was created for a class assignment to demonstrate JavaFX GUI design, event handling, input validation, and simple financial calculations.
